## description ? 
Given two strings s and t, return true if s is a subsequence of t, or false otherwise.

A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).

## example ? 

Example 1:

> Input: s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc" <br>
> Output: true <br>

Example 2:

> Input: s = "axc", t = "ahbgdc" <br>
> Output: false <br>

## constraints ? 

- 0 <= s.length <= 100
- 0 <= t.length <= 104
- s and t consist only of lowercase English letters.
